# NBA Teamwork Analysis

## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing NBA teamwork using data scraping, processing, analysis, and regression modeling techniques.
The analysis includes player performance, teamwork metrics, and the development of predictive models.
This project is part of my Master's thesis, which can be accessed [here](https://hdl.handle.net/11296/r9vjcz).

The project is divided into three primary steps:
1. **Web Scraping** - Collecting data on NBA players and teams.
2. **Data Processing and Analysis** - Cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data to extract meaningful insights.
3. **Regression Models** - Applying machine learning models to predict team performance and player impact.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains all the code for scraping, processing, and analyzing the data, as well as implementing regression models.
- **data/**: Stores all the raw and processed data files.
- **NBA_ID/**: Contains files related to NBA player ID processing.

## Requirements

- Python
- Conda
